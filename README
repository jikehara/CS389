The purpose of this project was to familiarize ourselves with the following frameworks and utilities.

Play! Framework

The base template for this project was built off of Nate William's Play tutorial found at https://github.com/YogoGit/play2torial/blob/master/JAVA.md.

To run the app, you must have the application.conf file configured correctly for the database you will have to create, and you also must have the sbt build tool installed.
