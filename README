=================================

The purpose of this project was to familiarize ourselves with the following frameworks and utilities.

Play! 2.x Framework
Spring Dependency Injection
Hibernate JPA w/ MySQL
SLF4J Logging
Unit Testing

=================================

The base template for this project was built off of Nate William's Play tutorial found at https://github.com/YogoGit/play2torial/blob/master/JAVA.md.

Some of the form creation and login and validation code taken from lwelna's TheButton found at https://github.com/YogoGit/theButton

The HTML5 Space Game adapted from MutMatts's PEWPEW found at https://github.com/Mutmatt/Pew-Pew

To run the app, you must have the application.conf file configured correctly for the database you will have to create, and you also must have the sbt build tool installed.
To run unit tests use the Scala Build Tool 'sbt test' command

We used a lot of code that came from other people. Here is some of it:
